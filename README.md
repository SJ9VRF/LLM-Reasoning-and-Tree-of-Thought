## Overview

 This project is designed to explore and implement **Prompt Engineering** techniques for **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, leveraging advanced methodologies such as **Chain of Thought (CoT)** and **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** to enhance AI reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.

## Introduction

### Understanding the Challenge

Large Language Models like GPT-4 have transformed the landscape of artificial intelligence, enabling applications that range from simple text generation to complex decision-making processes. However, to harness their full potential, it is crucial to employ effective **prompt engineering** strategies. Prompt engineering involves crafting precise and strategic inputs that guide these models to produce desired, accurate, and contextually relevant outputs.

### The Role of Chain of Thought

**Chain of Thought (CoT)** prompting is a technique that breaks down complex tasks into intermediate reasoning steps. By encouraging models to process information step-by-step, CoT enhances their ability to handle intricate problems, ensuring that outputs are logical and comprehensive. This methodology mirrors human problem-solving processes, fostering more transparent and understandable AI behavior.

### Introducing Tree of Thoughts

Building upon CoT, the **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** framework enables models to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. This tree-like exploration allows for systematic evaluation and backtracking, facilitating more robust and accurate solutions, especially for tasks that require strategic planning and exploration. ToT enhances the model's ability to consider various possibilities and outcomes, leading to more informed and reliable decision-making.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: For version control. Install it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tree-of-thoughts-project.git
   cd tree-of-thoughts-project
   ```
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

#### API Key Setup
Obtain your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/).
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in your scripts or set it as an environment variable.

#### Model Selection
The project supports multiple GPT-4 models:

- **gpt-4o-mini**: Cost-effective, recommended for initial experiments.
- **gpt-4o**: Balances capability and cost.
- **gpt-4-turbo**: Highly sophisticated, best for complex tasks.

You can specify the model when initializing the `GPT4` class.
